BHP_SU_V7.0  README_AFTER_INSTALLING

SHELL WARNING:
It is recommended that you use Bash or Korn shell when running
BHPIO commands. BHPREAD uses [] to define trace increments, and uses
^ to define arbitrary traverses. Bash and Korn shells have both
been used successfully. Using Bourne shell requires that you use \^
in place of ^. C shell requires \[ and \] to use square brackets.

Listed below is a brief description of each tool in V7.0.
See each program's self-doc for details on parameters, etc.

BHP3DNMO - NMO for multiple lines, using user-specified arbitrary velocity 
           functions

BHPALIAS - makes an aliased version of a BHPIO dataset

BHPARCHIVE - makes tar achive of BHPIO datasets

BHPBIN - assign inline/xline numbers to traces

BHPCOPYHDR - copies traces headers to samples or vice versa

BHPCWT - generates wavelet transform coefficients for traces
 
BHPFILL - trace infill interpolation.

BHPHORIZON - builds 'horizon traces' by loading horizon times from      
             an ASCII file to a trace as samples

BHPINTEGRATE - Calculate the area of a peak or trough                 
               at a user-specified time

BHPIO - a utility program used to display a summary of a BHPIO 
        dataset, and optionally, to delete the dataset

BHPLOADHDR - Load Trace Header from X,Y lookup in ASCII file

BHPMAKEHDR - calls SU modules suaddhead and sushw to construct trace    
             headers for C binary or Fortran direct access data

BHPMAKEMODEL - combines depths from a BHPIO horizon dataset with
               velocity and other information in an ASCII file to build 
               a BHPIO horizon-based model dataset
BHPMODEL - upgrade of BHPMAKEMODEL; writes BHPIO format

BHPMAKEEVENT - makes a null-filled event dataset

BHPMAKERC - converts a time model built by BHPMAKEMODEL to a
            reflection-coefficient model, which can then be used to
            make time synthetics

BHPMERGE - merges the header index files of requested bhpio        
           datasets which were written by bhpwriteseq

BHPMOD2SEIS - converts horizon-based velocities to SU velocity traces

BHPMODVEL -  Convert ROFF model traces from depth to time, using
             a user-supplied velocity function

BHPNAVMERGE - Merges navigation data from a P1/90 ASCII files into SU trace
              headers

BHPREAD - Read bhpio dataset

BHPRESTORE - restores BHPIO dataset from archive made by BHPARCHIVE

BHPROFFREAD - export reservoir properties from a ROFF model

BHPROFFWRITE - converts BHPIO data to a ROFF binary file suitable for import

BHPSCAN - a utility program used to find holes in a BHPIO      
          dataset

BHPSLICE - flattens BHPIO events at specified output times and proportionally
           stretches or squeezes data between the events

BHPSMOOTH - ensemble smoother which is used to smooth output from bhpcwt

BHPSTOREHDR - Store Trace Headers Values in ASCII file

BHPSU2USP - converts traces from SU format to FreeUSP format

BHPSYNTH - builds time synthetics from a reflection coefficient model dataset
BHPSYNTHETIC - upgrade of BHPSYNTH which writes BHPIO format directly

BHPTD - converts seismic data traces from time to depth and vice versa

BHPTDH - converts BHPIO horizon data from time to depth and vice versa

BHPTDV - converts velocity traces from time to depth and vice versa

BHPTEMPLATE - general-purpose SU source for getting panels      
              of traces for user algorithm processing

BHPTRANSPOSE - makes a transposed version of a BHPIO gridded dataset

BHPUSP2SU - converts traces from FreeUSP format to SU format

BHPVELUTIL - converts velocities between various formats

BHPWAVELET - Make Wavelet

BHPWRITECUBE - writes a BHPIO dataset in "hypercube" format

BHPWRITESEQ - writes a BHPIO "sequential" dataset
 
NEWBHPREAD - test version of bhpreadcube that includes ability to read both
             cube and sequential formatted data
