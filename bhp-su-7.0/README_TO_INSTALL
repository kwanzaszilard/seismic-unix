BHP_SU_V7.0 README_TO_INSTALL

Seismic UNIX is a prerequisite to installing BHP_SU,
because all the BHP_SU tools use SU libraries.
In addition, you need the same tools you used to build
SU, i.e. gmake and a C compiler.

A good place to install BHP_SU is next to Seismic UNIX.

For example, if your CWPROOT is /apps/freesoftware/su34,
you could put BHP_SU_V7.0 in /apps/freesoftware/BHP_SU_V7.0

The BHP_SU directory structure is set up to support all
three platforms. If you are on IRIX64, your object
and executable files are saved in obj/IRIX64 and
bin/IRIX64 directories. Linux platforms use obj/Linux
and bin/Linux directories, and Solaris platforms use
obj/SunOS and bin/SunOS.

BHP_SU ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
Two environment variables are required: PLATFORMID and PRGROOT.

Set PLATFORMID to the result of the uname instruction:

C shell
setenv PLATFORMID `uname`

Bourne shell or BASH
export PLATFORMID=`uname`

Set PRGROOT to the name of the PARENT directory of BHP_SU_V7.0:
 
In the example discussed above, it would be /apps/freesoftware

C shell
setenv PRGROOT /apps/freesoftware

Bourne shell or BASH
export PRGROOT=/apps/freesoftware

BHP_SU PATH REQUIREMENT
In addition to allowing builds for multiple platforms, BHP_SU
has a three-tiered set of execution directories, which you may or
may not choose to implement. Each bin/$PLATFORMID directory has three
parent directories: dev, beta, and prod. If you just want a single
executable and don't want to release beta and production versions
of any modification you make, then the default is to always build to
the dev/bin/$PLATFORMID directory. However, if you are using source-code
versioning and want to keep separate codes for development, beta usage, and
production usage, you can do so. Every BHP_SU make file has a defult make,
which makes to dev/bin, a "make beta", which "promotes" dev/bin to beta/bin, and
a "make prod" which "promotes" beta/bin to prod/bin.

For each bin directory you choose to use, you will need a PATH definition:
C shell
path = ($path:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/dev/bin/$PLATFORMID)        For single version case
path = ($path:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/beta/bin/$PLATFORMID)       For a beta relese
path = ($path:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/prod/bin/$PLATFORMID)       For a production release

Bourne, Korn or BASH
export PATH=$PATH:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/dev/bin/$PLATFORMID
export PATH=$PATH:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/beta/bin/$PLATFORMID
export PATH=$PATH:$PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/prod/bin/$PLATFORMID

Once you have set up your environment and path, you need to edit the
configuration file in  $PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/dev/makefile.$PLATFORMID.config.

The default settings should work in most cases, but you may need to change the
location of your compiler and/or libraries.

Then, you can cd to $PRGROOT/BHP_SU_V7.0/dev and enter gmake.

After building BHP_SU, refer to README_AFTER_INSTALLING for an overview of BHP_SU.
